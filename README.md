# Extra Challenge Shrines
This mod adds 3 new Shrines that affect the Teleporter event fights and their rewards:
* Shrine of the Sky - a red item drops in addition to the green drops, BUT the boss is elite. Stacking increases the amount of bosses and red drops.
* Shrine of the Core - 3 white items will drop instead of 1 green, BUT the boss is a Horde of Many. Stacking increases the amount of bosses and item drops.
* Shrine of the Wind - Select the boss that you want to fight and increase the yellow drop chance. Stacking increases the amount of bosses and yellow drop chance.
